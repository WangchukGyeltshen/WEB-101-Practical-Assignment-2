Assignment 2: Frontend Foundation & Application
Structure
Introduction
In this first assignment, you will establish the foundation for your web application by setting up
the development environment, implementing core routing functionality, and creating essential UI
components. This assignment focuses on building a strong foundation/structure that will support
the additional features in upcoming assignments.
Learning Outcomes
LO1: Describe fundamental concepts of web development (package managers, runtime
environments, frameworks)
LO3: Develop a multiple-page application using routing techniques
LO7: Design and implement reusable components adhering to single responsibility principle
Project Overview
1. Project Planning:
○ Select an application to develop (either a new concept or based on an existing
app)
○ Define the core functionalities that will showcase the learning outcomes
○ Discuss a basic project plan outlining the features to be implemented across all
assignments
2. Development Environment Setup:
○ Set up a React/Next.js frontend framework
○ Set up a remote repository on GitHub for code collaboration between your team
members
3. Application Structure & Routing:
○ Document the file-based routing structure in the README file
○ Implement navigation to reusable components using slugs. (example. For
instagram a reusable component for the reels page could ingest the data and be
reused multiple times based on the data given from the server)
https://nextjs.org/docs/14/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes
○ Set up route guards/protection for pages that will require authentication later
4. Component Development:
○ Plan and document on the readme file on the creation of the reusable UI
components based on your topic
5. Documentation:
○ Document the project setup and architecture in the README.md
○ Include clear instructions for setting up the development environment
○ Document each component with its purpose, props/inputs, and usage examples
○ Add comprehensive code comments explaining complex logic
